        <p>	Yellow walls spotted with water damage and mold. A floor lamp of frosted glass atop a black pillar in the corner--no light otherwise in this makeshift conference room gone gargantuan by lack of a table. He pressed through the retractable wall, pulling on the handle and guiding it through its shrieks.
        </p>
        <p>	What unfolded before him, panel by panel, was identical save a door in the opposite corner and a white board upon which “I have seen the Hollow Face of God” was scrawled in his handwriting. A red marker uncapped and dried out lay on the floor but he remained without memory of this time or this space. It was much warmer and brighter than the Ohio Winter Night he was walking through. Apprehension kept his charcoal-shaded parka on. Fear, a short ton weight behind his navel, kept him moving.
        </p>
        <p><em>If this is your punishment…</em>
        </p>
        <p>Jimmy, all 28 years of him, lived in quiet at his parent’s house. After he dropped out of college, after countless youth sports leagues evacuated following the purchase of a jersey, after each spare event of a relationship failed, it was evident that he lost interest well before the first true step was taken. 
        </p>
        <p>Left foot, right foot, it felt like a mimicry of forward motion against the vastness of the space. Expanding out of view, the doors looked the same and were spaced at equal intervals. 
        </p>
        <p>With a mental shrug, the door he chose swung open to reveal a ballroom with a chandelier ablaze with half-height candles. The parquet floor supported old patterned chairs all green and gold around tables enshrouded in blonde linen. 
        </p>
        <p>All wavelengths transmogrified into
        </p>
        <p id="alignright">Quiet.</p>
        <p id="alignright">Silence.</p>
        <p id="alignright">Motionlessness.</p>
        <p>Not a soul in sight. 
        </p>
        <p> The size of the room, its emptiness and its shadow and its meant-for-crowds nature made Jimmy uneasy. He awaited the footfall or the rustle that would be his signal to run. 
        </p>
        <p>Yet, still, 
        </p>
        <p id="extraindent">nothing.</p>
        <p>Rooms upon rooms amid the growing malaise and perhaps peace of acceptance.
