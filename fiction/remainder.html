        <p>Everything changed when it rained nails. Pam Zelzah headed across the factory floor, from her office to the break room on the opposite side of the building. She was around 40 with blonde hair and grey eyes, the only woman on the board at the brewery.</p>
        <p>Giant vats, stainless steel clad in copper for that “old timey” look that the tourists passing through liked so much, and machinery glimmered around her, fermenting the product, ever so slowly, until the point at which it was ready to be harvested.</p>
        <p>As she passed by a scissor lift where someone high above was fixing the ceiling, she felt something hit her shoulder. She looked up to see nails coming from above. She screamed and covered her face, trying to escape.</p>
        <p>The maintenance worker in the lift screamed, “Shit!” as his hammer fell toward the earth, gaining velocity, quicker and quicker, until it landed on Pam’s head, cracking her skull like the shell of a walnut and killing her. The nails tinkled around her, the hammer came to rest in the warm pool of her blood. “Oh God oh God oh God” you could hear the maintenance worker repeat as he panicked in the slowly lowering basket.</p>
        <p>—</p>
        <p>They watched the Hiker for two days as he moved alone along the trail. They, the creatures of Light with blue skin aglow, moved through a space mere inches from the ground. Silent as ghosts. They are focused. There are three of them now triangulating around his resting body in a yellow and silver sleeping bag. One at the head, one at the foot, one at his right hand. They reveal their palms to the sky, opening their four-knuckled, two-thumbed hands toward the great beyond.</p>
        <p>Above, a swirling crimson vacuum begins to form among the rain clouds. The stars turn to lines and a portion of the sky grows into a vacuous whorl.</p>
        <p><em>Upward! Upward!</em>The hiker’s body begins to rise.</p>
        <p>—</p>
        <p>Once Sam clocked out and reached his car, he checked his phone. It had been dead for the past couple hours and he missed the call from an unknown local number.</p>
         <p>They left a voicemail. Sam began the voicemail with his finger over the delete key figuring it was someone saying he’d been pre-approved for something but….</p>
        <p>“This is Officer Threets with LAPD.” His finger retreated, “We regret to inform you that your mother passed away today in an accident at work.” His heart stopped, Threets continued, “As is procedure, we’ll need you to come to the station to identify her body. Please contact me at…”</p>
        <p>Sam’s thoughts went dull, his body went numb, his mouth went dry, his ears were overtaken by a ringing. He ran a hand through his brown hair, wiped his eyes. At 24, he was unwilling to believe he was already orphaned. His dad had died of cirrhosis so long ago and now this? This didn’t seem real. He sat in his car--sat and sat and sat with the voicemail on repeat, each time praying it said something different. But the message refused, was locked in its place in time. Sam called Threets back and arranged to see his mother.</p>
        <p>When he got home, he immediately turned and walked out. He shared the place with his mom–it was her place, everything was hers. The floral couches, the TVs, the peach walls were hers. The flood of memories and the despair and the unflagging confusion were his.</p>            <p>It smelled like Japanese cherry blossoms, her favorite scent now hovering throughout a place empty and cold and unmoved since he left this morning. Shadows fell over the eastern wall, darkening the pictures that hung there: moments suspended of a person forever gone.</p>
        <p>He didn’t know how to cope is what it was. I mean, how does somebody? he wondered before he thought of walking. </p>
        <p>He turned and left and went to the police station to find Officer Threets. He needed to get this over with. He needed to leave.</p>
        <p>Threets was an overweight man in his fifties clad in the desertine brown of the Sheriff’s uniform. His balding hair was buzzed short.</p>
        <p>Sam was led down the hall as they made for the Coroner’s office, the utility belt and weaponry that adorned Threets’ waist jingled with every step. Sam dragged ass to prolong the waiting, prolong the time before he had to see his mom one last time.</p>
        <p>They entered the observation room, the door closed quietly behind him. It was a small space cordoned off from the rest of the room by a wall with a metal-latticed window.</p>
        <p>Sam looked through the glass. It felt as if it were a TV screen, unreal and detached from actuality. It still was not his mom who laid under a sheet on a gurney mere steps away.</p>
        <p>The coroner appeared from out of the darkness and looked at Threets who in turn looked at Sam: “Ready?”</p>
        <p>Sam nodded in spite of totally not being ready for any of this. Threets nodded back to the coroner who removed the sheet.</p>
        <p>Her skull is fissured. </p>
        <p>They cleaned out the viscera from the wound.</p>
        <p>They shaved her head.</p>
        <p>It was unmistakably Pam Zelzah, mother of Samuel Zelzah.</p>
        <p>He vomited on the glass.</p>
        <p>—</p>
        <p>They had been waiting for him. Surreptitiously, hoping he’s the key, genetically chosen and well sought after. An entire world he knows nothing about. The hope is that his blood will save them.</p>
        <p>Their race had homogenized, they were dying out. But they found through Universal Knowledge, that which connects All through All, of planets and people, that Earthlings, humans, people had a genetically similar structure and their blood could be fused with theirs.</p>
        <p>“Their genes are just like ours but locked by their innate interpretation of time.” is what they realized.</p>
        <p>He was their first candidate for Unlocking. They were going to see what happens when they modify his genes to match theirs. Put him in the Aura Chamber and see him be utterly changed into understanding--knowledge that leads to peace even if he is a million miles from home and never can go back.</p>
